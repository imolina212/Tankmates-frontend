					Q: Your Favorite thing about working on tankmates.com?
				</div>
				<div>
					A: Being able to continue learning while having the
					opportunity to apply those skills on a project related to a
					hobby that I am passionate about makes is by far my most
					favorite and rewarding part of working on tankmates. Working
					on tankmates has allowed me to be able to familiarize myself
					with redux and be able to successfully implement it. It also
					has given me the opportunity to continue providing future
					updates to tankmates in integrating a payment API (Stripe,
					Dwolla, etc.) and user authentication services like Firebase
					for its popular federated identity providers like Google,
					Facebook and Twitter, and more.

				<div>Q: What is your favorite fish and why?</div>
				<div>
					A: My favorite fish is a Red Cherry Shrimp / Crystal Red
					Shrimp. A younger me would have preferred something like a
					dragon looking Arowana but ever since I was able to
					successfully maintain a shrimp colony during the pandemic,
					these shrimps have taken its spot. A bonus has been
					discovering how much I love the de-stress factors that a
					planted aquarium.{" "}

				<div>Q: What would your dream aquarium be?</div>
				<div>
					A: My dream aquarium would be to have backyard pond with
					some waterfalls and koi fish so I can have a nice place to
					relax after a long day of work and to drink my morning
					coffee.

				Top 5 Tips for hobbyists
				<ul>
					<li> When in doubt, test your water.</li>
					<li>Build an ecosystem, not an aquarium.</li>
					<li>
						Watch your fish for 20 minutes at a time by sitting
						still youâ€™ll see new behaviors.
					</li>
					<li>
						Experiment and learn what works for you instead of doing
						only what others say. Evolve from being the student to
						being the master of your hobby.
					</li>
					<li>
						Less is more. Fewer species allows you to learn about
						their needs.
					</li>
				</ul>
